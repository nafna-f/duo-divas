# DuoDivas Planning Page 
 
_Due to the nature of this project, we have decided having a planning page / file will help keep transparency and organize our thoughts. Previously, this was a google docs, but having to upload a pdf file over and over seems very counterintuitive._ 
 
**General Process:** 
 
- Use a sorting sequence to randomize the data. 
 
**Questions:** 

- ~~What are we getting from this data specifically?~~
- ~~Is it randomized?~~
- ~~Specifically, what do you want?~~
- ~~Is this program for seats of ONE AP Course, or multiple? When I run it, what is this "input", so to speak?~~
- ~~What graphical interface?~~
- ~~A Flask App? Or something in the terminal?~~
- Do we count waitlists? Do we make waitlists?
- What about duplicate ranking?
- APENG? We don't know what APENG courses are being ranked.
- Do we take into account if they've taken the AP course before?
